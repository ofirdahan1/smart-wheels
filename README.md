After a long time that I have been working as a technician of UAVs I discided to see if I can get into the world of robotics by myself and build a robot .so I decided to start with trying to build an electrical skateboard. At first, I was sketching and deciding what I need to buy for this project. So I started with the purpose of what is needed to do, I wanted that he will be able to skate fast on multiple kinds of field conditions and not only solid roads (like grass, soft sands, little rocks, low stairs…). So for that, I have wanted a big board with a strong shield and axis and shock absorber. At that point in life, I didn’t have too much money to spend so I've been efficient as much as I could with the spending. The best place to buy all of this material was Aliexpress, there I compere etch part of the board by measurements details by the description of the sales and eventually after a long time most of the part came.

The board was needed to be with a foot holder(like a snowboard) case after I calculate the max speed(approx.) with a site that you put details of the engine & battery and spin ratio I saw that it could get to 55 km/h and its very fast for skating. From knowing that I would work with a current of up to 90 amp I needed a good castle(from the period of the technician). 

Castle: Phonix 160 edge HV 

Motor: AXI gold line( I made adjustments there for my tools with a friend that have a CNC machine)

For the communication with the  castle, I order a normal RC with a receiver for electric skateboard from Aliexpress and case my castle doesn’t know to change the  direction of the current (usually castle for electric skateboard knows) so I did some adjustments with the remote controller

Then I needed to plan how the circuit is gonna because I had one battery(42V) and two castles and motors so from understanding how the current need to flow I soldered the wires in a parallel circuit structure.

So I connect all the "parts" that I had and make(there were a lot of adjustments and creativity)  and after a couple of fails, it finely worked.

Then test out of the field and annoying my dog.

Test with me on it.

make some braking and more complex tests with a friend that wearing protectors equipment.

Here I noted that it could be very vast so I decided to change the ratio of the teeth between the engine and wheels to get more movement and less speed (by decreasing the number of teeth on the engine tooth wheel adaptor.)

Then I took it for a 4 km ride around my house and it worked perfectly.

Then I decided to build a charger for my 42V lithium battery(cause after exploring about that I saw it could be much more chipper and also I like to learn).
For this, I asked my neighbor for help(cause he understand more than me about electricity), at the beginning, we understand the structure of my battery and how she wired it. Then I understood according to forums that the charger needs to stabilize each cell simultaneity while charging so I needed to adapt for that the right BMS. After a lot of understanding and right soldering each wire we also seceded to build it properly.

In the year 2021, I learned at the university programing in python and Matlab so I wanted to use this knowledge and make this skateboard into a smart robot that can detect obstacles and operate as well for safety. For that, I understand the best way is to program it with Arduino and sensors.
So in the beginning, I needed to learn how Arduino code work(c++) and how is the structure code should be. For the first, I dealing with LEDs

To understand more I combined two sensors: distance& LCD

After some testing my old receiver tried to make problems and stop to work so then I needed to change all the RC chips to Arduino chips and get the right data for the project by wifi.

For the first time after different algorithms in the Arduino which include:

•	Limit/stop the speed of the wheels

•	Making right and left turns

•	All changes on the wheels work in gradual spins which make it safer for the riders and not surprisingly which   could be dangerous.

Here we can see it working real(not yet on the field) I'm using the RC that I build the computer blocks the view for him.
