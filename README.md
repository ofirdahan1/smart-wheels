Electric skateboard with sensors The project that improving over time.

Achievements:

•	Building skateboard

•	Make it electricity sate board

•	Knowing how to program it with Arduino

•	Building  RC with Arduino 

Next goals:

•	Test the brake algorithm on the field.

•	Test the help turn algorithm.

•	Write an algorithm to move around small obstacles.


After a long time that I have been working as a technician of UAVs I discided to see if I can get into the world of robotics by myself and build a robot .so I decided to start with trying to build an electrical skateboard. At first, I was sketching and deciding what I need to buy for this project. So I started with the purpose of what is needed to do, I wanted that he will be able to skate fast on multiple kinds of field conditions and not only solid roads (like grass, soft sands, little rocks, low stairs…). So for that, I have wanted a big board with a strong shield and axis and shock absorber. At that point in life, I didn’t have too much money to spend so I've been efficient as much as I could with the spending. The best place to buy all of this material was Aliexpress, there I compere etch part of the board by measurements details by the description of the sales and eventually after a long time most of the part came.
